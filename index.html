    <p>
A software bug occurs when an application or program doesn’t work the way that it should function. Most errors are faults or mistakes made by system architects, designers or developers. Testing teams use bug tracking to monitor and report on errors that occur as an application is developed and tested.

“A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known bugs,” says Wikipedia. “Facts may include the time a bug was reported, its severity, the erroneous program behavior and details on how to reproduce the bug; as well as the identity of the person who reported it and any programmers who may be fixing it.” 2

During its lifetime, a single defect could go through several stages or states. They include:

Active: Investigation is underway
Test: Fixed and ready for testing
Verified: Retested and verified by quality assurance (QA)
Closed: Can be closed after QA retesting or if it is not considered to be a defect
Reopened: Not fixed and reactivated 3
Bugs are managed based on priority and severity. Severity levels help to identify the relative impact of a problem on a product release. These classifications could vary in number, but they generally include some form of the following:

Catastrophic: Causes total failure of the software or unrecoverable data loss. There is no workaround and the product can’t be released.
Impaired functionality: A workaround may exist, but it is unsatisfactory. The software can’t be released.
Failure of noncritical systems: A reasonably satisfactory workaround exists. The product may be released if the bug is documented.
Minor: There is a workaround or the issue can be ignored. It does not impact a product release.
Usually, states and severity levels are monitored in a bug tracking database. A good tracking platform also ties into larger software development and management systems: the better to assess error status and the potential impact on overall production and timelines.

Examples: A button doesn’t submit the form, the search doesn’t react to the user input, the app crashes. Every time you perform an action and the website/app doesn’t respond as you expected, it might be a functional issue. Our limited information about our customers' products and lack of knowledge of their implementations make it difficult to determine whether an observed behavior is intentional or actually a bug. Making educated guesses based on experience and analyzing the product behavior by testing different scenarios can help you to come up with answer.

                <p>These bugs slow down the application, causing long loading times, lag, or inefficient use of resources and Software performance is an essential element in determining its usability and greatly influences users’ perception of the product.
                  

It is mainly related to the stability, speed, or response time of software resources. Any defect that undermines these features falls into the performance bug category.

This type of programming defect causes significant performance degradation and leads to a frustrating user experience, not to mention user abandonment and the potential loss of millions of dollars.

Is the response delay ten times longer than described in the requirements? We are probably facing a performance bug. A really BAD performance bug, I’d say.

 

Performance bugs hide well--
Dealing with performance bugs can be especially tricky. In fact, according to research, fixing performance bugs is generally more difficult than fixing non-performance bugs, even though the two types of fixes are equally prone to errors.

While most non-performance bugs can be detected through observing the negative effects of bugs, a large percentage of performance bugs must be spotted through code reasoning.

Basically, performance bugs usually don’t generate incorrect results or crashes in the program under test. Therefore, they cannot be detected simply by checking the software output.

      <p>In programming, a syntax bug refers to an error in the syntax of a program. Syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how a programming language's code should be written. When you write code that doesn't follow these rules, it will cause a syntax error.
Syntax bugs are among the most common types of errors programmers face, especially for beginners. Syntax errors typically prevent code from running, can be easy to identify since they are usually flagged by the code editor or compiler, and they can be corrected by fixing the code that contains the error or errors.</p>

      <p>In software testing, a compatibility bug refers to an error that occurs when an application or software is not compatible with a particular operating system, hardware, or software. These bugs often arise when developers create a program that works well on one platform or device, but not on others.

Compatibility bugs can create significant issues for users of the software, and they can be particularly frustrating for those who encounter them. Compatibility bugs can cause an application to crash, display unexpected errors, or cause other malfunctions in the program.</p>

      <p>In software testing, a unit level bug is an error that occurs within a single function or a small section of code. These bugs often result from programming mistakes such as logical errors, missing or incorrect code statements, or incorrect data types.

Unit level bugs can have significant consequences for the software application, as they can cause crashes, errors, or unexpected results that can impact the functionality of the program. However, because they typically occur within a small section of code or a single function, they are relatively easy to locate and fix.

Unit testing is a commonly used technique to identify and fix unit level bugs. Unit tests are designed to test individual functions or pieces of code to ensure they are working correctly. This allows developers to locate and resolve bugs earlier in the development process, before the code is integrated with other modules or parts of the software.</p>

    <article id="importance of bug"><h3>Why bug tracking is important</h3>
   <center><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/8cjpn0bwx327/5INWfUurvcWEj4jjjvRyaM/8a100d9cd3a6f11ffe034b9ba28ec7f3/istock-1061323160-scaled-1200x800.jpg" style="height:300px; weidth:300px;"></center><p>
It is estimated that software developers make 100 to 150 errors for every thousand lines of code.4 According to a report by the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ): “Even if only a small fraction—say 10 percent—of these errors are serious, then a relatively small application of 20,000 lines of code will have roughly 200 serious coding errors." 5

Software testing is essential for isolating and mitigating errors. A good QA process can uncover hundreds or even thousands of defects, and testing teams need to manage all of them. Integrating bug tracking into the testing workflow improves efficiency by helping testers prioritize, monitor and report on the status of each error.

“Defect tracking helps ensure that bugs found in the system actually get fixed,” says Agile consultant, Yvette Francino. “Tracking tools not only provide a way to ensure follow-through but also provide valuable metrics. Depending on the tool that is used, the team can tie defects to changed code, tests or other data that will allow for traceability or analysis on defect trends. If a certain module is riddled with defects, it may be time to review and rewrite that module." 6

Ideally, testing should be done as soon as possible—when bugs are easier and far less costly to fix. An earlier study by IBM found that defects found post-production or after release can cost 15 times more to fix compared to errors resolved early in development.

Many teams are now using a methodology that is known as continuous testing. In this case, quality testing and feedback are conducted at all stages of development, from design and coding to deployment. Modern technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), too, can aid the testing process by detecting and analyzing bugs early in the lifecycle.

      <center><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQGluo8RPD_HHg/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1608014989353?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=5upzGzlvsaPJeA3Uhnjrd7OtsRRlclkRpEyAtFQ2cTc" style="height:300px; weidth:300px;"></center><p>
Quality control is critical for developing robust applications. Software testing change management and bug tracking tools allow teams to uncover defects, measure their scope and impact — and resolve them.

In the Harvard Business Review, Nicholas Bowen outlines a process for managing defects. The first step is to classify and prioritize: “Generally, teams will prioritize two types of bugs: those that cause a system to crash and those that are less severe but could be pervasive....Next, decide your target response time for each level of severity. If the quality management system is new, then the initial focus should be on fixing the most severe bugs within hours or days. As you use your system, you can gather data on two key metrics, incoming bug rates and the productivity of the bug fixers, and adjust your targets as needed.” He says that organizations also need to create a system where defects and the time that is required to resolve them can be reviewed at all levels, from the CEO on down.7

A good bug tracking system can assist this process by providing a single workflow for defect monitoring, reporting and lifecycle traceability. It should further link with other management systems for shared visibility and feedback both within software development and the larger organization. IBM® Rational® ClearQuest®, for example, provides a centralized platform for error tracking and reporting. It integrates with other IBM development and change management systems, and helps improve communication and collaboration among developers, operations and broader teams.

As well, look for testing and tracking systems that use AI to detect errors early in the development process. It can optimize the number and types of tests that teams run, automate the testing process and use AI to analyze past defects and prevent them in the future.
